ANNOTATED TRANSLATION OF THE DAŚABHŪMIKA-SŪTRA1

INTRODUCTORY STANZAThose who aim at the enlightenment should listen to this declared Daśabhūmika
Sūtra in which the ten best meritorious perfections are shown in several ways, the ten
stages are proclaimed by the omniscient in order to benefit the worldly people, and the
pure middle way free from destruction and permanence announced:

INTRODUCTIONI have heard thus. Once upon a time the Blessed One dwelt in the divine world called
Paranirmitavaśavartin,not long after his perfect enlightenment – in the second week –
in the palace of divine king Vaśavartin which was full of maṇi-jewels and shining with a
great multitude of Bodhisattvas,who were all not liable to turning back (from the road) and
limited to (only) one (more) birth, before reaching the supreme perfect enlightenment, and
who had come together from each world-region.All of them 1) dwelt in obtaining the range
and scope of the varieties of knowledge of all Bodhisattvas,2) had the scope of not abandoning
the attainment of entering into the range of the varieties of knowledge of all Tathāgatas,3)
were skillful in showing all the actions by sustaining power at the right time and
moment when they mature and discipline all the worldly people,4) had the scope not abandoning
the accomplishment of the vow of all the Bodhisattvas and participating in the actions
in [all] kalpas, times and realms,5) had practised the affording of inexhaustible livelihood
to all worldly people by fulfilling the necessary preparation of merits, knowledge
and supernatural faculties of all the Bodhisattvas,6) attained the supreme perfections of
wisdom and expedient (upaya) of all the Bodhisattvas, skilful in showing the gate to metempsychosis
and nirvāṇa, and (118) not giving up to devote themselves to the course of conduct
of Bodhisattva,7) were skillful in showing all the actions by supernatural intuitions exhibiting
the contemplations, emancipations, meditations, concentrations, supernatural intuitions
and knowledge of all the Bodhisattvas,8) attained the control of the supernatural
powers of all the Bodhisattvas, approached the assembly of all the Tathāgatas in a moment
without effort, became the foremost preachers,holding the wheel of the doctrine of all the
Tathāgatas, and rose up to revere and serve Buddhas widely,9) attained the appearance of
(their own) bodies in all the world-regions by exerting themselves for the equality in obtaining
the acts of all the Bodhisattvas,10) have resounded their unobstructed voices and sounds
over all the realms of ideas, and have suffused all spheres of unobstructed mind and
knowledge in the three (kinds of) time (past, present, future),11) were praised for their
inexhaustible merits, having fulfilled the merits and exercises of all the Bodhisattvas and
manifesting the (Buddha's) sustaining power in innumerable world-ages,

such as (See the Sanskrit text)and, having them as their leaders, (other) immeasurable, unfathomable,
countless, unthinkable, unequalled, immense, endless, limitless, unlimited, unobtainable,
and inexpressible Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas have come together from different Buddha's
realms, led by Vajragarbha Bodhisattva.

B Then indeed Bodhisattva Vajragarbha at that time has attained the Bodhisattva-meditation called
‘The Splendor of the Great Vehicle’ by Buddha’s might.As soon as Bodhisattva Vajragarbha
attained this Bodhisattva-meditation called ‘The Splendor of The Great Vehicle’, Tathāgatas
the number of which is comparable with the atom-dusts in hundred millions of Buddha's
realms showed their faces beyond the world-regions (the number of which is) comparable
with the atom-dusts in hundred millions of Buddha's realms in the ten directions. These Venerable
Buddhas, having the same name Vajragarbha, spoke as follows.

“Good! good! oh son of the Conqueror! that you attain this Bodhisattva-meditation called ‘The
Splendor of The Great Vehicle’,but indeed, o son of the noble family, these Tathāgatas having
the same name Vajragarbha (the number of which is) comparable with the atom-dusts in
hundred millions of Buddha's realms sustain you beyond the world-regions (the number of which
is) comparable with the atom-dusts in hundred millions of Buddha's realms in ten directions
by the sustaining power of the former vow of this venerable Vairocana (or the Sun)
and by your distinguished merit and knowledge. D “In order that all the Bodhisattvas 1) enter
into the stage of knowledge disclosing unthinkable splendor of the Buddha's doctrine,2)
assemble all the basic merits,3) are skillful in investigating all the Buddha's doctrines,4)
extend the knowledge about doctrines,5) elucidate the well settled doctrines,6) purify
the unadulterated knowledge,7) do not defile all the worldly things8) purify the supermundane
basic elements,9) realize the range of unthinkable knowledge,10) realize up to the range
of knowledge of the omniscient, namely to attain the commencement of the ten stages of
Bodhisattva,11) elucidate properly the respective determination of the Bodhisattva-stages,12)
acquire all the Buddha’s doctrines,13) contemplate the differentiation of the inclinations
without evil influences,14) are skilled in the great splendor of wisdom with well-chosen
investigation,15) enter into the gate of well accomplished expert knowledge,16) show
the inside-disclosing and sharp (fearless) eloquence in the appropriate place,17) accomplish
the stage of great analytical knowledge,18) do not lose the memory of the thought of enlightenment
(bodhicitta),19) mature the regions of all the living beings,20) attain the skill
in all-penetrating exegesis.

E “Again indeed, o son of noble family, this paragraph of the doctrine helpful in opening of
the gate to the splendor of the doctrine should be preached to you 1) by Buddha's might and
by the sustaining power of the splendor of Tathāgata's knowledge,2) in order to purify
your own basic merits,3) in order to purify completely the realm of ideas,4) in order to favor
the regions of living beings,5) in order to substantiate the knowledge of the body of
the doctrine,6) in order to receive the coronation by all the Buddhas,7) in order to show
the (great) body which excels all the worlds,8) in order to surpass the states of existence
of all the worlds,9) in order to purify the states of existence of supermundane things,10)
in order to fulfill the knowledge of the omniscient.”

F Then indeed these venerable Buddhas provided for Bodhisattva Vajragarbha 1) the unsurpassed
body,2) the elucidation by unobstructed eloquence,3) the entrance into the discrimination
of well purified knowledge,4) the sustaining power not losing the memory,5) the skill of
well determined thought,6) the non-abandonment of intellect which goes everywhere,7) the
state of being uncrushed (even) by the power of a perfectly enlightened one,8) the state of
not shrinking (even) before the confidence of Tathāgata,9) the establishment of doctrinal
principle distinguished by the knowledge of the omniscient and the analytical knowledge,10)
the accomplishment of the ornament of well distinguished body, word and mind of all the
Tathāgatas.

By what reason? Because he 1) attains the ultimate essence of meditation, 2) accomplishes former
vow,3) well purified his resolute intention,4) well cleansed the circle of knowledge,5)
well collected the necessary preparation,6) well did the purifying preparation,7) is the
vessel of immense memory,8) purifies the clear confidence,9) well penetrated the non-breaking
of the gate of magic formula,10) well sealed the position of the fingers by the knowledge
of the realm of idea.

H Then indeed these venerable Buddhas, standing there, streched their right hands and stroked
the head of Bodhisattva Vajragarbha by their supernatural power.I As soon as being touched
by these venerable Buddhas, then Bodhisattva Vajragarbha stands up from this meditation.
J And (he) addresses these Bodhisattvas

“This Bodhisattva's vow, o honorable sons of the Conqueror, is well determined, unadulterated,
unseen, wide as the realm of ideas, terminated in the region of empty space, terminated
the future extremity and rescued the regions of all the living beings.Where, indeed, o honorable
sons of the Conqueror, Bodhisattvas enter into the stage of knowledge of venerable
past Buddhas, enter into the stage of knowledge of venerable future Buddhasand enter into
the stage of knowledge of venerable present Buddhas, there, o honorable sons of the Conqueror,
the ten stages of Bodhisattva enter into the stage of knowledge of venerable Buddhas,and
there, o honorable sons of the Conqueror, ten stages of Bodhisattva, with reference to
which I am talking thus, have been announced, will be announced and are being announced
by past, future and present venerable Buddhas.

What are the ten? Namely, the stage of Bodhisattva called 1) joy, 2) immaculate, 3) splendor,
4) brilliance, 5) difficult to be overcome, 6) facing, 7) going far, 8) immovability, 9)
good intelligence and 10) cloud of doctrine.Those, o honorable sons of the Conqueror, are
the ten stages of Bodhisattva which have been announced and are being announced by past,
future and present venerable Buddhas.I do not, o honorable sons of the Conqueror, see the
extension of the Buddha's realm where Tathāgatas do not bring to light these ten stages of
Bodhisattva.By what reason? Excellent, o honorable sons of the Conqueror, is this light of
doctrinal gate which purify the Bodhisattva's path of Bodhisattvas the great Beings, that
is the differentiation of the division of ten stages.Unthinkable, o honorable sons of the
Conqueror, is this matter, that is the knowledge of stage.”

K Then indeed Bodhisattva Vajragarbha, having narrated only the names of these ten stages of
Bodhisattva, was silent and did not elucidate the division anymore.

Then indeed the entire assembly of Bodhisattvas was eagerly desiring (an explanation). As only
the names of these ten stages of Bodhisattva are heard and the divisions of the stages
of Bodhisattva are not uttered,

they think as follows, “By what reason and cause, indeed, Bodhisattva Vajragarbha, having narrated
only the names of these ten stages of Bodhisattva, spends his time in silence and does
not elucidate the division any more?”

Again at that time indeed in this Bodhisattva’s assembly a Bodhisattva named Vimukticandra has
come and sat together (with the others). Then indeed Bodhisattva Vimukticandra, having
known the deliberation of mental intention of the Bodhisattva's assembly, questioned Bodhisattva
Vajragarbha by singing (the following) verses.

1) For what purpose, o mighty one endowed with pure thought, memory, knowledge and merit, is
it that you, having proclaimed the excellent stages, do not bring to light (the division
of these stages)?

2) All these Bodhisattvas are well determined and of great fame. Why, having proclaimed the
stages, you do not speak of the division (of them)?

3) All these confident sons of the Conqueror want to hear. Divide properly and speak of the
understanding of .the meaning of the stages.

4) Indeed this assembly is calm, free from sloth, agreeable, pure, established in firmness and
endowed with merit and knowledge.

5) Observing each other all of them stood with respect and long for the highest nectar as (bees
long) for pure16 honey.

6) Having heard this Vajragarbha, son of the Conqueror, with great wisdom and confidence speaks
out in order to satisfy the assembly.

7) Most difficult an I extraordinary is this manifestation of Bodhisattva's practices through
which the highest division of the cause of the stages i.e. the attainment of the state of
Buddha is (reached).

8) Subtle, difficult to see, free from constructive thoughtl?, devoid of the extent of mind
(citta-bhumi-l)igata), hard to be met and without evil influence is the range of wise ones
in which the worldly people (will) be bewildered if they hear it.

9) Having made up the heart (hard) like diamond, inclining towards the best knowledge of Buddha,
having known the extent of mind without self, this subtle knowledge can be heard.

10) Like a color-painting in the atmosphere, like wind resorting to the path of birds, the knowledge
of the venerable one, difficult to be seen and without evil influence, is thus here
classified and specified.

11) The following thought occurs to me “Difficult to be met with in the world is one who knows
this and one who believes this highest (doctrine).” Therefore I do not venture to reveal
it.

L After this was spoken Bodhisattva Vimukticandra said to Bodhisattva Vajragarbha.

”Indeed, o son of the Conqueror, well-purified is this assembly of Bodhisattvas who have 1)
well-purified resolute intentions, 2) well-purified thought, 3) well-performed the practices,
4) well-served thousand billions of Buddhas, 5) well-collected the necessary preparations,
6) been endowed with immense merit and knowledge, 7) been separated from doubt and suspense,
8) been free from blemish, 9) well-settled the resolute intention and confidential
faith and, 10) never depended upon other (heterodox teachings) in these Buddha's doctrines.
Well! o son of the Conqueror, speak, because these Bodhisattvas stay before your eyes in
this place.”

M Vajragarbha said “Even though, o son of the Conqueror, this assembly of Bodhisattvas has 1)
well-purified resolute intentions,

............ 10) never depended upon other (teachings) in these Buddha's doctrines,

and yet others would hear such unthinkable matters and would produce doubt and suspense. This
would be useless, harmful and painful to them for a long time. This is my benevolent mind
with which I long for silence.

N Then indeed Bodhisattva Vimukticandra again requested Bodhisattva Vajragarbha (to explain)
this meaning.“Bravo! o son of the Conqueror, speak it. Only by the might of Tathāgata such
unthinkable matters would be wellguarded and believed.By what reason? Because, o son of
the Conqueror, when the elucidation of these stages is spoken the ultimate essence of things
is acquired, that is what all the Buddhas intend deliberately.And all the Bodhisattva get
into the eagerness to guard this stage of knowledge.By what reason? Because this is the
first course of conduct this is the arrival at Buddha's doctrines.For instance, o son of
the Conqueror, all the graphemes (grammata), words, numbers and elucidations are preceded
by letter matrices and end with letter matrices, and there is no grapheme, word (syllable),
number or elucidation which is without the elucidation of letter matrices.Just so, o son
of the Conqueror, all the Buddha’s doctrines are preceded by the stages as they perfectly
develop the course of conduct, and end with a stage as it attains the self-existent knowledge.

Therefore speak, o son of the Conqueror! Tathāgatas, Arhants and Perfectly-Enlightened-Ones
will sustain with protection.

Then indeed at that time all these Bodhisattvas requested Bodhisattva Vajragarbha (to explain)
this meaning with recitation of verses, singing in one sound.

1) O one with best, excellent, pure intelligence! with welltelling and endlessly exerting intellect!
Speak best sweet words possessed of the highest truth!

2) O one with firm mindfulness and pure intelligence! Proclaim the pure intention acquired by
the power of the ten faculties, the ten investigations by analytical knowledge and the ten
highest stages.

3) With good minds fixed by calm restraint, without impurity by arrogant and conceited views,
free from doubt, this assembly prays for your speech.

4) Like a thirsty one longs for cool water, a hungry one for food a sick one for good remedy,
and a multitude of bees for honey, the assembly waits for your word.

5) Therefore, o one with pure intelligence, declare the excellent stages which are free from
passion, possessed of the ten faculties, without attachment, and proclaim the whole state
of existence of the Sugata.

P Then indeed at that time a beam named The Splendor of The Power of Bodhisattva issued out
from the hair-circle of venerable Sakyamuni.It is followed by numberless beams and shines
to the extent of all the world-regions in all ten directions. It quiets all the evil states
and pains. It darkens all the abodes of Evil Ones. It illuminates immense assemblies of
Buddha. It shows the unthinkable majesty of the disposition of Buddha's sphere. It illuminates
the Bodhisattvas sustained by the sustaining power of doctrinal elucidation in all the
assemblies of Tathāgatas to the extent of all the world-regions in all ten directions. It
shows unthinkable miracles of Buddha. It makes a great house on the top of a dense cloud-net
of beams above in the atmosphere. And it stands.Also the beams named The Splendor of
The Power of Bodhisattva issued out from the hair-circle of venerable Buddhas.Having issued
out they are followed by numberless beams and shine to the extent of all the world-regions
in all ten directions. They quiet all the evil states and pains. They darken all the abodes
of Evil Ones. They illuminate immense assemblies of Buddha. They show the unthinkable
majesty of the disposition of Buddha's sphere: They illuminate the Bodhisattvas sustained
by the sustaining power of doctrinal elucidation in all the assemblies of Tathāgatas to the
extent of all the world-regions in all ten directions. They show unthinkable miracle of
Buddha. They illuminate this assembly of the venerable Sakyamuni and the body of Bodhisattva
Vajragarbha. They make a great house on the top of a dense cloud-net of beams above in
the atmosphere. And they stand.Thus indeed by these beams issued out from the hair-circle
of venerable Śākyamuni these world-regions and these Buddha’s assemblies and the bodies and
seats are clearly illuminated and shown. And by beams issued out from the hair-circles
of these venerable Buddhas in immeasurable world-regions these triple thousand great thousand
world-regions and this assembly of the venerable Śākyamuni and the body and seat of Bodhisattva
Vajragarbha are clearly illuminated and shown.

Then indeed from this great house on the top of a dense cloud-net of beams such voice issued
out by Buddha's might.

1) By the doctrines of one born in Śaka-family, identical with the unequalled (one), identical
with empty space, eminent because of the ten faculties, with endless foremost merits, best
among divine and human beings ......... the sustaining has been made.

2) Disclose by the majestic power the store of Sugatas the kings of doctrine, the best lofty
conduct and the stage of knowledge with divisions.

3) Those to whose range of hearing the excellent method of doctrine has gone, are sustained
by Sugatas and supported by Bodhisattvas.

4) Having fulfilled the stainless ten stages one by one and having attained the ten faculties,
they will fix the conqueror-ship.

5) (Though) sunk down in the water of the ocean or thrown into the worldconflagration they are
no doubt able to hear this method of doctrine.

6) But those who are attached to perplexity and are approached by doubts, do not get to hear
this in any way.

7) Speak the excellent way of the knowledge of the stages, the entrance, the staying, the passage
from one stage to another, the course of conduct and the sphere (of the stages).

Q Then indeed Bodhisattva Vajragarbha, having beheld the ten directions, at that time spoke
these verses in order to awaken faith in this assembly in especially high degree.

1) The subtle way of the great sages is incomprehensible, without ·constructive thought, free
from constructive thought (akalpa-kalpapagata), very difficult to touch, unstained, known
(only) by the discretion of learned men, tranquil by nature and without destruction and
origination.

2) Void by nature, tranquil, non-dual, indestructible, freed from the states of existence, entered
into nirvāṇa by obtaining equality, without extremity and middle, not to be uttered
hy word, freed from the three (kinds of) time, identical with the sky.

3) Calm, tranquillized, known (only) by Sugata, very difficult to be described by all the ways
of utterance. The stage and the course of conduct are like this, very difficult to speak,
how much less to hear.

4) It is free from the thinking and the way of mind, known (only) by the king of muni who produces
knowledge, not manifested (prabhavita) by aggregates, physical elements and senses,
not unrlerstandable by mind, nor considered by thought.

5) As the foot-step of a bird in the sky cannot be uttered nor seen (even) by intelligent ones,
so all the stages of the son of the Conqueror cannot be uttered, how much less be heard.

6) But from now I will mention successively only the introductory part through (my) benevolence,
compassion and vow. The stages are not within the range of mind. Accomplish the stages
with knowledge according to (your) intention (mental disposition).

7) Such range is difficult to see. He is indeed not able to proclaim the stages who relies on
his own intention. But I will announce them by the compassionate might of the Conqueror.
Listen, all showing complete accord and respect.

8) Indeed that entrance into knowledge is such that it cannot be declared even in world-ages.
Listen! I will speak succinctly this whole truth of the meaning of doctrine as it stands.

9) Respectful and well prepared venerable ones! Bravo! I will speak (it) by the blessing of
the Conqueror. I will utter the sound of the excellent doctrine, accompanied by illustrations,
profitable and with weJl balanced syllables.

10) It is very difficult to say it with words. (Therefore) the immeasurable Blessing of Sugata
has entered into me and has taken the shape of a ray, and by his blessing I have the ability
(to preach).
